# Spellbook

Herein lies a collection of enchanted scripts and mystical utilities, carefully crafted for the TypeScript mages who wield the power of the Deno runtime. This grimoire contains potent incantations and arcane formulae to enhance your magical coding practices.

## Tomes of Power

The Arcane Codex is divided into several independent tomes, each focusing on a different school of magic:

1. [Voidmancy](./voidmancy.ts) - The esoteric art of manipulating nothingness and channeling the void.
2. [Runecraft](./runecraft.ts) - Ancient techniques for weaving and unraveling the fabric of strings.

## Summoning the Arcane Knowledge

Each tome within this codex can be invoked directly in your Deno spells using its raw ethereal link. Simply channel the magical energies through the URL to access the power contained within.

### Incantation Example

```typescript
import { summonFromVoid } from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metdxt/spellbook/master/voidmancy.ts";

const mysticalEssence = summonFromVoid(potentiallyVoidValue);
```
